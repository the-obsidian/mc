# mc

`mc` is a command line utility for managing Minecraft servers.

## Installation

For now, until we set up binary distributions, you can install directly with go:

```shell
$ go get -u github.com/the-obsidian/mc
```

## Commands

* `mc install` - reads from server.yml to install dependencies (like plugins)
